## Review

I attempted to make a full fledged react portfolio with working contact form. Unfortunately, while I was able to get the contact form to run locally, I wasnt able to get it to run in production. I also ran out of time to add my resume, github and linkedin, but these are simply things that I can add in the future. I learned alot about react by creating this portfolio, so I think that it was definitely a worthwhile effort.
